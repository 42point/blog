Несколько цитат которые подзацепили когда писал статью про работу basecamp.

> But crisis mode is reserved for true crisis.

> What we have found to be true is Parkinson’s Law: “Work expands to fill the time available.” Give something 3 months and it’ll take 3 months. Give something 6 weeks and you’ll figure out how to get it done in 6 weeks.

> No OKRs, no metrics. We build what we think the product needs based on our own ideas and the distillation of customer requests. We don’t measure individual features’ performance/success unless there’s a specific a/b test in mind, but things that are a/b’d are almost always tied to conversion or payment. We don’t a/b features that aren’t financial in nature.
